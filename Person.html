            <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>
            
            <p>Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates
                Sr.(1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, and
                Irish/Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of
                directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather
                was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a
                younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or
                "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix. The family lived in the Sand Point
                area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishments and Contributions</h2>
            <p>In January of 1975, while pursuing his studies at Harvard, Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen read a
                cover story in Popular Electronics. The story was about a $350 Altair 8800 microcomputer made by a New
                Mexico based company called MITS. Bill Gates later recalled that at that point they had understood that
                the price of computers would soon drop to the point that selling software for them would be a profitable
                business. Gates dropped out of Harvard wanting to be at the forefront of computer software business. He
                soon co-founded Micro-soft (later named Microsoft) with Paul Allen and in over a decade and a half the
                duo built the most successful software company in the world.</p>

            <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
            <p>"One of the things that is interesting about Gates is the extent to which he stamped his own personality
                on the organizational culture of Microsoft and by extension on a great deal of the personal computing
                industry," says Thomas Haigh, a historian of computing at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.
                Haigh says Gates was a combination of a techie and a businessman who really wanted to get software out
                the door, win market share and beat the competition.</p>

            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <p>☛ Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.</p>
            <p>☛ It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.</p>
            <p>☛ The intersection of law, politics, and technology is going to force a lot of good thinking.</p>
            <h2>Remembering [Bill Gates]</h2>
            <p>Bill Gates Sr., the father of Microsoft founder Bill Gates III, is remembered as a gentle and humble soul
                who shaped the values of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.2 He was a collaborator, judicious, serious
                about learning, and hated anything that seemed pretentious.0 In 2003, he traveled with Bill Gates Sr.,
                promoting their book, Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes, during a
                push to abolish the estate tax.2 Bill Gates also remembered former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe
                and his commitment to making Japan a leader in global health.1</p>
